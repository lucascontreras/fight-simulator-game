"""
The character module defines the Character class, which represents a superhero character in the superhero battle game.

It contains methods to initialize a character with initial data, set their real stats, calculate their HP and attacks, assess damage inflicted during battles, and update their status based on their HP.

Classes:
    Character: Represents a superhero character in the superhero battle game.

Attributes:
    data (dict[str, str]): Data about the character.
    actual_stamina (int): The actual stamina of the character, initialized randomly.
    attack (list[float]): A list to store the damage for the 3 types of attack of the character.
    status (str): The status of the character ('游릭' for healthy, '游리' for wounded, '游댮' for defeated).
    fb (float): The filiation coefficient of the character, used in calculating real stats and attacks.
    hp (int): The hit points (HP) of the character.

Methods:
    set_real_stats: Sets the real stats of the character based on its initial data and team affiliation.
    set_hp: Sets the initial HP (hit points) of the character based on their stats and team affiliation.
    set_attacks: Sets the damage for the 3 types of attack of the character.
    calculate_attack: Calculates the damage of an attack based on the character's stats and weights.
    assess_damage: Adjusts the character's HP based on the damage inflicted.
    set_status: Sets the status of the character based on their current HP.
    __str__: Returns a string representation of the character, including their status, name, alignment, HP, and attacks.
